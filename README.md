# Satellite-Wallpaper-Updater

A lightweight Windows Forms application that runs in the system tray and automatically fetches the latest **full disk images of Earth** from **NESDIS GOES satellites**.

The app runs quietly in the background, updating images on a timer and keeping only the most recent photos for efficient storage. Deployment and updates are handled via **ClickOnce**, hosted on my personal website
